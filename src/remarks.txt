* container tags vs empty tags
* block elements vs inline elements
* The <body> container tag is used to group everything that gets displayed on a page. They
  are needed for the page to be compatible with all web browsers. A web page can contain only one
  body element.
* When some HTML tags go inside others, this is called nesting.
* The <head> container tag is used to include technical information about the page.
* HyperText is text that contains a link to another page. Web pages are called HyperText
  documents because they are conntected by HyperText links (or hyperlinks).
* You can nest hyperlinks inside other text elements, like <p>.
